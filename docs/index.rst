Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis for Python
================================================

These are a set of Python bindings to `Charlie Conroy's Flexible Stellar
Population Synthesis (FSPS) Fortran library
<http://www.ucolick.org/~cconroy/FSPS.html>`_.
Python-FSPS makes it easy to generate spectra and magnitudes for arbitrary stellar populations.
These bindings are updated in conjunction with FSPS, and are known to work with
FSPS svn revision 143.
